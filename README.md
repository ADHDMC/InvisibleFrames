# InvisibleFrames

## Simple toggle for invisible item frames

Shift-right-click to turn an item frame invisible/visible

Requires `invisibleframes.toggleframes` permission

there are currently 2 configuration options, defaults are
`lock-frame`: `true` and `toggle-empty`: `false`

`lock-frame` sets  the item frames to locked when they are invisible, stopping the items from being able to be knocked out, and having a random invisible item frame you cannot see

`toggle-empty` allows the item frame to be toggled when empty. This is off by default so as not to have random invisible frames everywhere

Roadmap:
* Reload command
* Different options for how to toggle
